Product Backlog:

The future, further developed version will include an app to build a custom wellness program from the available services. 
The inputs will go through an algorithm, which will apply different discounts for aggreagated services and output a price.

This version will also include a corporate space with a more sophisticated interface for corporate clients.

Finally, this will include more complex javascript to make the page more reactive and interactive.
